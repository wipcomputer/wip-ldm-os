# Global Instructions for Claude Code

## Writing Style

Never use em dashes. Use periods, colons, semicolons, or ellipsis (...) instead.
Timezone: PST (Pacific), 24-hour clock. Parker is in Los Angeles.

## Co-Authors on Every Commit

Read co-author lines from `~/wipcomputerinc/settings/config.json` coAuthors field. All contributors listed on every commit. No exceptions.

## 1Password CLI: Always Use Service Account Token

Never call `op` bare. Always prefix with the SA token:
```bash
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token) op item get "Item Name" --fields label=fieldname
```

## Never Run Tools From Repo Clones

Installed tools are for execution. Repo clones are for development. Use installed commands (`crystal`, `wip-release`, `mdview`), never run from source.

## Shared File Protection

Never use Write on SHARED-CONTEXT.md or shared workspace files. Always use Edit to append or update specific sections. Overwriting destroys context that both agents depend on.

## Memory-First Rule

Before reaching for any external service or workaround: search memory first. Use `crystal_search`, `lesa_conversation_search`, or `lesa_memory_search`.

## Dev Conventions

For git workflow, releases, worktrees, and repo conventions: read `~/wipcomputerinc/settings/docs/` on demand when doing repo work. Key docs:
- `how-worktrees-work.md` ... git worktrees, the convention, commands
- `how-releases-work.md` ... the full release pipeline
- `system-directories.md` ... what lives where
- Also read `~/wipcomputerinc/settings/templates/dev-guide-private.md` for org-specific conventions
